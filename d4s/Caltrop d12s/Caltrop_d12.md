## The Caltrop D12

There are 12 numbers on a d4, it's just that 1 to 4 is repeated 3 times each. Here is what it looks like numbered 1 to 12. Will you ever use it? Well, it is a bit of a novelty, but it was fun to do.

I know, I know, the numbers are on the bottom of the die. I had to do that to make the two digit numbers legible.
