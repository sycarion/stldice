All the stl files are shared under this license. I don't require it, but if you make dice with one or more of these designs, it would be nice if you could send me one. You can DM me on Twitter [@sycarion](https:/twitter.com/sycarion). 

## Origin

I have wanted to make custom dice for a long time. I enjoy a game called Paydirt that uses custom d6s, but the dice are no longer manufactured. I want to make them to keep this great American Football sim going. I was also inspired by the Dicecreator, specifically his [d4ized-d6](https://dicecreator.wordpress.com/2010/04/23/dice-crossbreeding/). I want to make Sicherman Dice that are not d6s, since an UNL graduate wrote a thesis about how that was possible. I want to make my own d30s.

I saw Michael Lombardi ([@TrebuchetOps](https://ttwitter.com/trebuchetops)) working on the designs of Pentola, an RPG requiring a customized d12. So I began a quest to learn enough Blender to make a master. I found [Cly Faker](https://www.youtube.com/c/ClyFaker/about)'s YouTube channel and the rest is history.

## Issues

The biggest issue is that I have no means to make dice. To make matters worse, I don't have a ventilated space that I can use, my house is weird in that all external outlets quit except for the one my garage door opener is using. That means that even if I had a resin printer for masters, I couldn't use it.

I'm also averse to monetizing my hobbies because they because a second job once I do.

## Result

I'm sharing the stl files so that those with the means can make their own dice. If it helps others, great!

This also means that I can't test the issues with my files. They look fine, but I may have made mistakes in the design, so please let me know if there are issues with the stl files.
