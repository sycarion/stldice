## The Dozenal D12

This die uses the Dwiggins symbols for dek (10) and el (11) and a Heavy Twelve Pointed Pinwheel Star for do (12). The unicode symbol for the star is U+1F7D4. I am not a member of any Dozenal Society, but I love the number system for many of reasons laid out in the wikipedia post about it.
